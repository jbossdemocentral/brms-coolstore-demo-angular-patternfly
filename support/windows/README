WINDOWS INSTALLATION:
====================
This directory contains a Windows Batch file and a corresponding VBScript file which is used as a
utility to unzip files (since Windows has no native unzip functionality within Batch files). 

unzip.vsb - utility to unzip files.

Notes and tips:
- the unzip.vbs file needs to be located in the root of the project.
- you might run into some issues while extracting some of the BRMS components because the 
  file path of the extracted file became greater than 255 chars (yet another windows 
  headache). By putting the project in a higher directory (c:\demo), the issue can be
  resolved.
- if you find errors with the installation, please fix and push back to project, we don't have
  a windows environment to test and keep these scripts updated.
